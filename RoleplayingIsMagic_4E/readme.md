# Roleplaying is Magic: Season 4 edition character sheet

This character sheet is for [Roleplaying is Magic: Season 4 edition](http://roleplayingismagic.com/),
a popular fan-created tabletop RPG system based upon the world of
My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and developed by Roan Arts.

## RiM Dice script

The skill rolling buttons in this sheet make use of the
[Roleplaying is Magic 4E Dice API script](https://github.com/Cazra/roll20-api-scripts/tree/mlpDice/RoleplayingIsMagic_4E_Dice)
for rolling dice and skill checks for the Roleplaying is Magic system. If you use
this sheet, it is highly recommended that you also install this API script for
your campaign.

For the skill rolling buttons to work, you must also be speaking as the
character you are rolling the skill for.

The script can also be used as a chat command. This is documented in the
script's header comment.

## Untrained skills

For untrained skills, it is advised that players should add Mind, Body, and
Heart as untrained skills to the Skills section of their character sheets.
This will make it easy to use untrained skills with the RiM4 dice script and
the dice rolling buttons by just rolling one of these.
